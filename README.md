# QuickView
[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/pcolby%2Fquickview.svg)](https://github.com/pcolby/quickview/releases/latest)

QuickView is a very simple, basic image viewer.  Think of it as a replacement for
[Windows Photo Viewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Photo_Viewer) (which
sucks almost as much as [QuickTime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicktime) when
it comes to obfuscating real content with useless UI chrome).

## Keyboard Shortcuts
