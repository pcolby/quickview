# QuickView

QuickView is very simple, basic image viewer.  Think of it as a replacement for
[Windows Photo Viewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Photo_Viewer) (which
sucks almost as much as [QuickTime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicktime) when
it comes to obfuscating real content with useless UI chrome).
